[CORE 007 - Begin Revenge..]

There is Our Armies is stationed at Empyrrean in old time, now They come to a crisis Annihilation.
But We have The Necro.
&YUse them for Resurrect wreckage to destroyed Our unit or Enemy unit.&
And New Arm's unit Vulcan, Capture it to make ours!

TIP:
If at all possible, must Secure The Enemy's resources.
Specially, Will must pay careful attention to administer Energy.
Necro with part of produce Unit, certainly Guard it.
If them die, This mission will very defficult.
Experctated &REnemy's Nuclear Attack& so Find hedgehog -the Mobile Anti Nuke missile launher- wreckage and Resurrect it.
If searching this maps, you'll can find usually wreckage or Enemy's Structures before work yet, so search wide area you can.
When Attack the Vulcan base, Do not immoderate advance.

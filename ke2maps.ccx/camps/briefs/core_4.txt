[CORE 004 - Acid Battle]

Enemies Already almost be command at surround of Galastic Gate.
We are in a disadvantageous position by The Enemy Hover Craft And Pelican Rushes.
Making Hover Units in large quantities And So Annihilate Enemies!

&RAttention:&
Build Sea Fort over the Acid Sea is Foolish conduct.
&YBecause acid liquid Continuous Dicreasing Hit Point of the Water Units.&
There is Acid liquid places, Using Hover and Air Units to Battle at this place is far the better conduct you are.

Suggestion:
The ARM's Pelican rush is Defence with Hover and Air Units are hard to solve.
When this time, Defending by previously produced Submarines is Good.
Also When product Hover Units in large quantities, Guarding of Commander is essentiality.

[CORE 008 - The Rule OF Core]

We are develop new weapon Buzzsaw to Copy The Arm's Vulcan.
So We construct it near Arm's Central Base for testing The Power of the Buzzsaw.
Now terribly The Enemies are coming soon.
making up Quickly Resources and Armies and fight against the Arm's large force!

InFomation:
Arm will give priority to FARK and The Samson Guarding over the other production way.
Now Defence many Vulcan for Arm's Central Base so do not attack this area to carelessly.
be known about Arm commander in their base to us, so Remove him and their armies be &RTotal Annihilate&, too.

Suggestion:
&GFind back gate of The Enemy base.& if attack to this way, it's can easy than head on collision with The Front.
Vulcan is very powerful but Don't working no Energy so find first the power plants and destroy it, can be easily battle.

GOOD LUCK !
